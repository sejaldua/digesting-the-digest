This cash crisismeans many Afghan citizens lack access to important services, as the UN warns of a growing humanitarian disaster.  Asef Khademi, who was previously working to modernize the country’s financial systems, is one of the many people now hiding in Kabul who wants to leave Afghanistan, but his hope is waning fast.  Khademi is afraid because for the last few years he has been working for an internationally-funded project to bring digital currency and banking into people’s lives, called the Afghanistan Payments System, or APS.  It was an important project: the Afghan economy runs on cash, and only 10-15% of citizens have a bank account. APS was meant to help Afghanistan become less cash-dependent. And, says Khademi, it was moving fast before the US withdrew its forces and the Taliban took over.  Now, though, as chaos continues to unfold in Afghanistan, the project has stopped, and cash is running out before any viable alternatives have been put in place.  But a different outcome was within reach, Khademi says: Afghanistan was perhaps just a year or two away from having a 21st-century digital banking infrastructure that could cope even if cash disappeared.

The specifics: In 1987, dozens of nations adopted the Montreal Protocol, agreeing to phase out the use of substances that were breaking down the ozone layer. But since many of them are also powerful greenhouse gases, as a major side benefit, their reduction over the last three decades has already eased warming and could cut as much as 1˚C off worldwide average temperatures by 2050.  More good news: A new studyin Nature highlights yet another crucial, if inadvertent, bonus: reducing the strain that ultraviolet radiation from the sun puts on plants, inhibiting photosynthesis and slowing growth. The Montreal Protocol avoided a catastrophic collapse of forests and croplands that would have added hundreds of billions of tons of carbon to the atmosphere.  Lessons to learn? All of which poses a question: Why can’t the world enact a similarly aggressive and effective international treaty designed explicitly to address climate change? "
2021-08-19 12:03:12+00:00,"  Solar panels are a pain to recycle. These companies are trying to fix that.  Vast wastage: Millions of solar panels have been installed in the last two decades—and since they typically last between 25 and 30 years, many will soon be ready for retirement and probably headed to a landfill. Only about 10% of panels in the US are recycled—it isn’t mandated by federal regulations, and recycling the devices is currently much more expensive than just discarding them.  A recycling push: New efforts to recycle these panels could reduce both the amount of waste and the new material that needs to be mined. The materials in solar panels coming offline each year could be worth an estimated $2 billion by 2050. New efforts, including one approach from a French startup called ROSI, are trying to recapture these valuable materials, especially silver and silicon, to make recycling the panels more financially viable.

2021-08-18 12:04:31+00:00,"There's a vast online effort underway to evacuate vulnerable Afghans    A mad scramble: The sudden collapse of Afghanistan's government has led to a frantic push to accelerate online relief and evacuation efforts. These attempts, organized largely via Google Forms, WhatsApp and private social media groups, are trying to fill the void left by the US government's failure to protect vulnerable Afghans. These include journalists, activists, academics, translators, and others.  What’s happening: Working largely online, informal networks of people in and outside the country have been organizing lists of Afghans eligible for different resettlement programs or even trying to bypass the slow-moving bureaucratic processes completely. Several groups were planning to charter planes for private airlifts, for example.  The danger: These efforts create their own set of risks—including risks to the safety and security of people’s vital personal information. You can’t always be sure who you’re interacting with, and it’s possible that the Taliban could be lurking in the same online spaces too. "
2021-08-18 12:04:31+00:00,"  Apple says researchers can vet its child safety features. But it’s suing a startup that does just that.  Questionable promises: When Apple announced new technologythat will check its US iCloud service for known child sexual abuse material, it was met with fierce criticism over worries that the feature could be abused for government surveillance. Faced with public resistance, Apple insisted that its technology can be held accountable. In an interview, an executive insisted that researchers can inspect what’s happening in its iOS phone software.  But, uh… Apple is suing a company that makes software to let security researchers do exactly that. In 2019 it filed a lawsuit against Corellium, which lets researchers cheaply and easily test mobile devices by emulating their software rather than requiring them to access the physical devices. In the lawsuit, Apple arguedthat Corellium violated its copyrights, enabled the sale of software exploits used for hacking, and shouldn’t exist. The startup countered by saying that its use of Apple’s code was a classic protected case of fair use. The judge has largely sided with Corellium so far. "
2021-08-17 12:02:54+00:00,"How to talk to vaccine-hesitant people    It’s been eight months since the vaccine rollout began in the US, yet one in three adults remain unvaccinated. But they're not all firmly anti-vaccine, and many may be open to persuasion. With the delta variant ripping through many communities, getting vaccinated matters more than ever. So how do you change minds?  My colleague Tanya Basu has some tips: * Check your biases. People are complicated, and their reasons for not getting the vaccine are personal. Respect those reasons and you might have a more productive conversation. * See if the person is open to the conversation. If not, it might be a better use of your time and energy to simply back away. * Be kind. The person you are trying to communicate with will shut you out immediately if you are disrespectful. * Identify the obstacle. Ask if there’s anything you can do to ease their burden or help eliminate any barriers. * Consider the humble text message. Confrontations on social media rarely work. * Tailor your argument to the person. Consider their specific worries and try to address them. Don’t use jargon or talk down. * Be a “cooler.” People who have had similar concerns, yet gone ahead and got vaccinated, may be more likely to persuade others than someone eager to get their shot at the first opportunity. * Have your sources ready. Present facts in a clear way that isn’t condescending. "
2021-08-16 12:03:34+00:00,"How digital beauty filters perpetuate colorism    When Lise was a young teenager in Georgia, her classmates bullied her relentlessly. Most often, they would attack her with remarks about her dark complexion. Sometimes teachers would send her home from school because she couldn’t stop crying.  And it wasn’t just white classmates. Black students harassed her too. She remembers them asking, “Why is she so dark?”  Just when she thought it couldn’t get worse, the phone in her palm became an endless stream of pictures of beautiful, lighter-skinned women getting dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of likes and affirming comments.  The prejudice Lise experienced—colorism—has a long history, driven by European ideals of beauty that associate lighter skin with purity and wealth, darker tones with sin and poverty.  These prejudices have been part of the social and media landscape for a long time but today, thanks to the prevalence of selfies and face filters, digital colorism has spread. With Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook a part of billions of people’s everyday lives, many of us find that people see far more pictures of us than ever before. But there are biases built into these systems, and they could be particularly catastrophic for women with darker complexions. "
2021-08-13 12:04:06+00:00,"Stop saying “delta plus.” It doesn’t mean anything.    If you’ve been worried by recent news stories about a strain of covid called “delta plus,” it may freak you out to hear that scientists just expanded the delta family from four variants to 13.  Please take a deep breath. Scientists would really like you to understand that there’s no evidence delta has learned any new tricks, and these new names are for helping keep track of covid’s evolution—not nine new reasons to panic. And many researchers are also really, really hoping you’ll stop saying ‘delta plus.’ (  “The name ‘delta plus’ is completely incorrect, because it gives the perception that this will cause more damage,” says Anderson Brito, a member of the Pango Lineage Designation Committee, which assigns scientific names like B.1.1.7 to new branches of the virus.

2021-08-13 12:04:06+00:00,"  Deleting unethical data sets isn’t good enough  A lingering problem: For years, AI researchers scraped the web for the images and text they need to train their models. Some of the data sets they created contain millions of photos of ordinary individuals who have never given their consent for their images to be used. The practice is now legally risky and frowned-upon. As a result, AI researchers have increasingly retracted the data sets they created this way. But the privacy concerns linger in an internet forever-land.  The specifics: A new studyshows that problematic data is still widely proliferating and being used. The authors selected three of the most cited data sets containing faces or people, two of which had been retracted; they traced the ways each had been copied, used, and repurposed in close to 1,000 papers. They found that many still exist on third-party sites and in derivative data sets built atop the original. Part of the problem, according to the paper, is that those who put together data sets quickly lose control of their creations.  A fix? The authors provide several recommendations for the AI community around responsible and ethical data collection and use. But some want to take it further. "
2021-08-12 12:01:27+00:00,"Mathematicians are deploying algorithms to stop gerrymandering    The maps for US legislative races often resemble monsters, with bizarrely shaped districts emerging from wonky hybrids of counties, precincts, and census blocks.  But it’s the drawing of these maps, more than anything, that determines how votes translate into who gets elected.  The question is, if the choice of maps is so important, which map should we choose, and how should we decide if someone has done a good job in choosing that map?  Over recent months, mathematicians have been busyin anticipation of a data release expected today from the US Census Bureau. Every decade, new census data launches the decennial redistricting cycle—state legislators (or sometimes appointed commissions) draw new maps, moving district lines to account for demographic shifts.  In preparation, mathematicians are sharpening new algorithms that detect and counter gerrymandering, whereby politicians rig the maps and skew the results to favor one political party over another. Republicans have openly declared that they intend to gerrymander a path to retaking the US House of Representatives in 2022. Tools like these algorithms will play a critical role in the looming political battles. "
2021-08-11 12:03:47+00:00,"The big tech quest to find the metals needed for the energy overhaul    ​​In recent weeks, every day that the weather permitted, a helicopter contracted by KoBold Metals flew over a remote part of northern Quebec carrying some unusual cargo.  A 115-foot-wide copper coil dangled from the belly of the craft, sending electromagnetic waves into the earth and creating currents in rocks deep underground. Any good electrical conductors sent telltale signals back to a receiver coil, suggesting that the rocks might contain valuable deposits of nickel and cobalt—metals used in the batteries powering cell phones, laptops, and electric cars, demand for which is expected to soar in the coming years.  The data collected is plugged into machine-learning models which advise the team on the best places to survey next. It’s a far cry from how geologists have traditionally hunted for mineral deposits. These days, data science and machine learning are becoming a bigger part of the effort to find the next big payday underground. "
2021-08-11 12:03:47+00:00,"  Chinese hackers disguised themselves as Iran to target Israel  The news: When hackers broke into Israeli computers in 2019 and 2020, evidence initially suggested they were from Iran. But on closer inspection, analysts concluded it was conducted by Chinese operatives posing as a team from Tehran, according to new research from American cybersecurity firm FireEye.  How they did it: Many of their tactics were blunt, such as using the word ""Iran"" in file paths. But they also wrote in Farsi, and deployed tools normally associated with Iranians. The attackers also took pains to protect their true identities by minimizing the evidence they left behind, and hiding the infrastructure they used to break into Israeli machines. Ultimately they failed. The hackers made several mistakes that blew their cover and linked them back to their previous work. For example, they used similar files, infrastructure, and tactics across multiple operations in the Middle East.  The significance: The attack was not particularly sophisticated or successful, but it shows how important attribution—and misattribution—can be in cyber-espionage campaigns. "
2021-08-10 12:03:10+00:00,"What we know about how the delta variant of covid is spreading    What’s happening: Covid cases in the US have doubled over the past two weeks, and scientists are now racing to understand the delta variant, which appears to account for the vast majority of new infections.  What we know: The delta variant is nearly twice as contagious as previous versions of the virus, according to the CDC. It also seems to lead to higher viral loads. The evidence suggests that vaccinated people may be able to transmit the virus, perhaps even just as readily as unvaccinated people. The overwhelming majority of infections are still in unvaccinated people. So far, it looks as if vaccines still largely work, especially in preventing severe illness.  What we don’t know: The appearance of a new variant has people worried we’ll see other, even worse variants. There is some genuine cause for concern: viruses mutate all the time, so as long as there are places in the world where there’s unchecked spread, we’ll likely continue to see more variants that will behave differently. The solution is to increase vaccination rates, and fast. "
2021-08-10 12:03:10+00:00,"  The UN climate report pins hopes on carbon removal technologies that barely exist  The news: The UN’s long-awaited climate report, released yesterday, offered a stark reminder that removing massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be essential to prevent the gravest dangers of global warming. But it also underscored that the necessary technologies barely exist—and will be tremendously difficult to deploy.  The specifics: The report found that greenhouse gases are likely to drive worldwide temperatures at least 1.5˚C above preindustrial conditions within the next 20 years, fueling severe heat waves, floods, and droughts. Once that happens, carbon removal is essentially the only way to bring the climate back to a safer zone, because the greenhouse gas persists for hundreds to thousands of years in the atmosphere.  A rosy view: The model used to create the most optimistic scenario in the report, which limits warming to 1.5˚C, assumes the world will create a brand-new carbon-sucking sector operating on the emissions scales of all America’s cars, power plants, planes, and factories, in the next 30 years or so. But much of the technology that would underpin it has only ever been proven in small-scale projects. "
2021-08-09 12:03:33+00:00,"Apple has defended its new anti-child-abuse tech against privacy concerns    What’s happening: Last week, Apple announced new technologiesto detect child sexual abuse material on iPhones. Apple says the new detection tool, called NeuralHash, can identify images of child abuse stored on an iPhone without decrypting the image. It says it has implemented multiple checks to reduce the chance of errors before the images are passed onto the authorities. The tool will roll out in the US this year.  The reaction? The controversial new features strike at the heart of concerns about privacy, surveillance, and tech-enabled crimes. Apple says these new features preserve privacy as they combat child abuse. For critics, though, the biggest question is not about what the technology might do today; it’s about what it could become tomorrow.  What’s next? There is an enormous amount we don’t know about what Apple is doing. An optimist would say that enabling full encryption of iCloud accounts while still detecting child abuse material is both an anti-abuse and privacy win. A realist would worry about whether this feature will be weaponized by governments for broadening surveillance. "
2021-08-06 12:11:45+00:00,"The $1 trillion infrastructure bill is a baby step toward the US grid we need   The problem: The US needs to add hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission lines in the coming decades. The lines would weave together fragmented regional power systems into an interconnected grid capable of supporting a massive influx of renewables.  Tell me more: A national network of short spur lines and long-distance, high-voltage wires would deliver wind, solar and hydroelectric power to where it’s needed when it’s available across the country.  Yay, great let's do it: Not so fast. For starters, it could cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build out the necessary power lines this decade alone. And states, counties, cities and towns across the nation would need to quickly sign off on a multitude of new transmission lines. Unfortunately, the US is terrible at permitting such multi-state projects.  But hang on, is that hope? The roughly $1 trillion infrastructure packagemoving forward in the Senate, which has bipartisan support, provides billions of dollars for transmission lines. "
2021-08-05 12:04:01+00:00,"Stop giving out booster shots until more of the world is vaccinated, says the WHO    The WHO has called for a halt to any booster vaccinations until the end of September, so that other places in the world can get their first shots.  The agency’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that while high income countries have given almost 100 shots for every 100 people, poorer countries have managed just 1.5 per 100 people. 80% of the 4 billion vaccines doses administered so far have been in high income countries.  ""We cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected,” he told a press conference.  He said a moratorium on boosters until the end of September would enable at least 10% of every country to get vaccinated.  The WHO’s latest intervention comes as a number of countries have started, or are considering rolling out, booster shots. Israel began administering third shots last month, and France, Germany and the UAE have all announced plans to begin a booster program. Others, like the UK and the US, are still considering it. But the science on whether boosters are even required is still uncertain. "
2021-08-05 12:04:01+00:00,"  New global map shows populations are growing faster in flood-prone areas  The news: Even as climate change and urbanization make floods more frequent and their consequences more severe, a higher proportion of people are living in areas that experience them.  How we know: In a new studypublished this week in Nature, satellite images were used to map over 900 flood events that occurred between 2000 and 2018, affecting between 255 million and 290 million people.  The population in these areas increased by 34.1% over the same period (the global population only grew by 18.6%). That means between 58 million and 86 million more people were exposed to flooding in those places.  Why it matters: The effort gives scientists a clearer picture of the scale and human impact of recent floods. Getting a more accurate picture of global flood risk might help steer funding for climate adaptation to the places that need it most. "

The so-called Key to NYC Pass (which, rather confusingly, is a program, not an actual pass) is part of a suite of efforts to fight the more-transmissible delta variant, as cases rise across the city.  What that means: To see a Broadway show, eat indoors at a restaurant, or use a gym, you’ll need to show proof that you’ve received at least one dose of a covid vaccine. (It won’t be needed for essentials, like grocery shopping.) Acceptable proof will include the state’s Excelsior Pass (which has faced a range of glitches and fairness concerns), as well as a new app released by the city, NYC Covid Safe. The requirement applies to both customers and employees of those places.  Why it’s happening: About 66% of the city’s adults are fully vaccinated, and officials hope the new requirements will convince more people to get the shots. "

2021-08-03 12:03:36+00:00,"The voices of women in tech are still being erased    In the middle of the night on May 24, TikTok changed its voice. The ubiquitous woman’s voice that could read your video’s text out loud in a slightly stilted, robotic cadence was suddenly replaced by one with an almost smirky, upbeat tone. Many users started calling the new one the “Uncanny Valley Girl” to express their displeasure. Lil Nas X even made a TikTok about it.  But what happened to the old voice? And who was the woman behind it?  Women's voices and bodies can be found all throughout the history of computing—from being heard in launch countdownsto being visible in photographs—but only relatively recently have historians written these women back into the narrativeby explaining what they did. For a long time, women were mistakenly thought to be peripheral to computing history, even though they were often the ones who programmed the computers.  And it is still the case that when we hear a woman’s voice as part of a tech product, we might not know who she is, whether she is even real, and if so, whether she consented to have her voice used in that way.  Many TikTok users assumed that the text-to-speech voice they heard on the app wasn’t a real person. But it was: it belonged to a Canadian voice actor named Bev Standing, and Standing had never given ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, permission to use it. "
2021-08-02 12:04:40+00:00,"Covid clusters among the vaccinated are killing our back-to-normal dreams    What’s happening: A handful of recent cases are proving that covid-19 transmission chains and superspreading events can occur even in groups where nearly everyone is vaccinated.  In the US: Investigators are learning from one particular outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a seaside town on Cape Cod, which in early July hosted a rowdy parade and crowded weeks of pool parties. Since then, health investigators say, there have been more than 800 cases of covid-19 linked to those events, 74% of which are in people who were vaccinated.  Viral loads: The Provincetown outbreak was caused by the delta variant, which now accounts for most cases in the US. The CDC said the “pivotal discovery” was that vaccinated people infected with delta in Provincetown appear to have just as much virus in their systems as those who are unvaccinated.  What it means: This suggests a rapid return to a layered approach of countermeasures, including masks and social distancing, which could also complicate school reopenings starting next month in the US. "
2021-07-30 12:04:05+00:00,"Hundreds of AI tools have been built to catch covid. None of them helped.    When covid-19 struck Europe in March 2020, hospitals were plunged into a health crisis that was still badly understood.  But there was data coming out of China, which had a four-month head start in the race to beat the pandemic. If machine-learning algorithms could be trained on that data to help doctors understand what they were seeing and make decisions, it just might save lives. That was the hope.  “I thought, ‘If there’s any time that AI could prove its usefulness, it’s now,’” says Laure Wynants, an epidemiologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, who studies predictive tools.  It never happened. The AI community rushed to develop software that many believed would allow hospitals to diagnose or triage patients faster, bringing much-needed support to the front lines.  In the end, many hundreds of predictive tools were developed. None of them made a real difference, and some were potentially harmful.  That’s the damning conclusion of multiple studies published in the last few months. But there's still hope for the future. "
2021-07-28 12:35:51+00:00,"What you need to know about the CDC’s new mask guidelines    The news: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendedthat vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor spaces in communities where covid cases are spiking. It’s also recommended that children in grades K–12 attend school in person while continuing to wear masks inside.  Why now? It’s only two months since the CDC said fully vaccinated people mostly no longer needed to wear masks indoors, so this new policy may seem like backtracking. But the CDC’s director, Rochelle Walensky, said the decision is driven by the rising infections caused by the delta variant. In May, delta was responsible for just 2% of cases sequenced in the US. Now it’sover 90%. And although unvaccinated people are driving this spread, vaccinated people can also get sick and pass on infections.  Am I affected? Probably, if you live in the US. Much of the country is experiencing what the CDC calls “substantial transmission rates,” which means the new recommendation would apply. Visit the CDC’s Covid Data Trackerto check.  What next? The US vaccination rate needs to improve, and quickly. "
2021-07-27 12:03:36+00:00,"The pandemic slashed the West Coast’s emissions. Wildfires already reversed it.    The news: Wildfires raging across the US West Coast have filled the air with enough carbon dioxide to wipe out more than half of the region’s pandemic-driven emissions reductions last year. And that was just in July.  The pandemic effect: California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington saw fossil fuel emissions decline by around 69 million tons of carbon dioxide last year as the pandemic slashed pollution from ground transportation, aviation, and industry.  But: From July 1 to July 25, fires in those states produced about 41 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to data from the European Commission’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.  The bigger picture: The numbers illustrate a troubling feedback loop. Climate change creates hotter, drier conditions that fuel increasingly frequent and devastating fires—which, in turn, release greenhouse gases that will drive further warming. The problem will likely grow worse in the coming decades across large parts of the globe.  What can be done? The good news is we do have some control over these forces. Nations can step up efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions as quickly as possible. And they can get more serious about halting deforestation while promoting tree-planting campaigns. "
2021-07-26 12:04:02+00:00,"Why researchers need to tinker with viruses    In May, the coronavirus researcher Ralph Baric found himself at the center of the debate over gain-of-function research, in which scientists engineer new properties into existing viruses. And during a congressional hearing, Senator Rand Paul implied that the National Institutes of Health had been funding such research at both the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Baric’s University of North Carolina lab, and that the two labs had been collaborating to make “superviruses.”  Baric released a statementclarifying the research in question did not qualify as gain-of-function, and none of the SARS-like coronaviruses he’d used in the experiments were closely related to SARS-CoV-2, yet that did little to quell questions about the role his research may have played in furthering scientists’ ability to modify coronaviruses in potentially dangerous ways.  Baric believes such research is essential to the development of vaccines and other countermeasures against emerging viruses, a project he has been engaged in for more than 20 years. His research laid the groundwork for the first approved anti-covid drug and helped speed the development of the mRNA vaccines that have proved so pivotal.  MIT Technology Review recently asked Baric to explain what constitutes a gain-of-function experiment, why such research exists, and whether it could have played any role in the pandemic.

2021-07-26 12:04:02+00:00,"  Meet the people who warn the world about new covid variants  In March, when covid cases began spiking around India, Bani Jolly went hunting for answers in the virus’s genetic code. Jolly, a third-year PhD student at the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi, studied sequences of samples taken from around India. As she did, she found a cluster that didn’t look quite like any known variant.  She went to the place where a small group of scientists give new variants their names: a system called Pango, which has quietly become essential to global covid research. It’s staffed by a handful of volunteers around the world, led primarily by a PhD student in Scotland, and its software tools and naming system have now helped scientists worldwide understand and classify nearly 2.5 million samples of the virus.  The Pango team quickly came up with a new name for the variant Jolly had identified: B.1.167, also known as “delta.”  Researchers, public health officers, and journalists around the world use Pango to understand covid’s evolution. But few realize that the entire endeavor—like much in the new field of covid genomics—is powered by a tiny team of young researchers who have often put their own work on hold to build it. "

Get your friends to sign up hereto get The Download every day. I hope you have a good weekend!  Is the UK’s pingdemic good or bad? Yes.    Oscar Maung-Haley, 24, was working in a bar in Manchester, England, when his phone pinged. It was the UK’s NHS Test and Trace app letting him know he’d potentially been exposed to covid-19 and needed to self-isolate. The news immediately caused problems. “It was a mad dash around the venue to show my manager and say I had to go,” he says.  The alert he got was one of hundreds of thousands being sent out every weekas the UK battles its latest wave of covid, which means more and more people face the same challenges. The phenomenon is being dubbed a “pingdemic” on social media, blamed for everything from gas shortagesto bare store shelves.  The ping deluge reflects the collision of several developments: sharply rising cases due to the delta variant, record numbers of app downloads, and far more contact than before as the UK has dropped many of its lockdown restrictions. More infections, more users, more contact: more pings.  That’s exactly how the app is supposed to work, yet it’s causing a significant breakdown in the social contract, as a lack of clear, fair rules is leading to widespread frustration. "

The details: So far the trove consists of 350,000 newly predicted protein structures. DeepMind says it will predict and release the structures for more than 100 million more in the next few months—more or less all proteins known to science.  Why it matters: The breakthrough could allow biologists from around the world to understand diseases better and develop new drugs. "
2021-07-22 12:03:39+00:00,"The impact of the pandemic on online activism    For the past year, people in the United States were supposed to live at a distance and keep to themselves to prevent the spread of a deadly virus. At the same time, there was a nationwide reckoning on systemic racism and inequality, a contentious election, and a rise in racist violence. The activism that met those crises was often organized wholly or partially online, sometimes by young people experimenting with creative new ways to build social movements.  My colleague Abby Ohlheiser spoke to four people in their 20s who, through the internet, became viral voices, key organizers, and vital resources over the past year. Read their stories.

2021-07-22 12:03:39+00:00,"  An albino opossum proves CRISPR works for marsupials, too    The news: CRISPR has been used to modify the genes of tomatoes, humans, and just about everything in between. Because of their unique reproductive biology and their relative rarity in laboratory settings, though, marsupials had eluded the CRISPR rush—until now. A team of researchers at Japan’s Riken Institute have used the technology to edit the genes of a South American species of opossum.  How they did it: The researchers used CRISPR to delete a gene that codes for pigment production. Targeting this gene meant that if the experiments worked, the results would be immediately obvious: the opossums would be albino if both copies of the gene were knocked out, and mottled, or mosaic, if a single copy was deleted. The resulting litter included one albino opossum and one mosaic opossum (pictured above).  Why it matters: The ability to tweak marsupial genomes could help biologists learn more about the animals and use them to study immune responses, developmental biology, and even diseases like melanoma.

2021-07-21 12:05:27+00:00,"Space tourism is just getting started    What happened: Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos successfully completed the company’s first crewed suborbital flight yesterday—a major step in its efforts to provide commercial space flights to paying customers. He was joined by his brother Mark, Dutch student Oliver Daemen and astronaut Wally Funk. Daemen and Funk became the youngest and oldest people to ever fly to space, respectively. The flight lasted just 10 minutes, but passed the Kármán line, the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. It was a test of the company’s reusable rocket and capsule system New Shepard.  What’s next: Compared with the launch earlier this month of Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, a type of spaceplane, Bezos’s trip was more reminiscent of a NASA mission, with a vertical takeoff, parachutes, and a soft landing. Together, the flights signify the start of commercial space tourism. Beyond getting humans closer to orbit, both Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin could advance new approaches to faster cross-continental travel, since both vehicles can reach speeds four to five times those of a regular airplane.

But An Ugly Truth, a new book about Facebook written by veteran New York Times reporters Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang, argues that Facebook’s issues today are not the product of a company that lost its way. Instead they are part of its very design, built atop Zuckerberg’s narrow worldview, the careless privacy culture he cultivated, and the staggering ambitions he chased with Sandberg. Read our review of the book.  —Karen Hao  Disability rights advocates are worried about discrimination in AI hiring tools  Your ability to land your next job could depend on how well you playone of the AI-powered games that companies like AstraZeneca and Postmates are increasingly using in the hiring process. Some companies that create these games, like Pymetrics and Arctic Shores, claim that they limit bias in hiring.  But AI hiring games can be especially difficult to navigate for job seekers with disabilities. In the latest episodeof MIT Technology Review’s podcast “In Machines We Trust,” we explore how AI-powered hiring games and other tools may exclude people with disabilities.

2021-07-20 12:05:05+00:00,"What the latest Pegasus spyware leaks tell us    The news: Over the weekend, a consortium of international news outlets published their findings from an investigation into the use of Pegasus, the marquee spyware product of the secretive billion-dollar Israeli surveillance company NSO Group. (Its CEO, Shalev Hulio, is pictured above.) The reports are based on a leak of tens of thousands of phone numbers that appear to have been targeted by Pegasus. The outlets were able to use the data to establish that journalists and activists in many countries were targeted—and in some cases successfully hacked.  The significance: The leaks indicate the scope of what cybersecurity reporters and experts have said for years: that while NSO Group claims its spyware is designed to target criminals and terrorists, its actual applications are much more broad. The NSO used its standard line for the latest leak, denying all allegations. But it has also argued that it can’t be held responsible if governments misuse the technology it sells them. "
2021-07-20 12:05:05+00:00,"  Cities are scrambling to prevent flooding  What’s happening: US cities are working to shore up their flood defensesin the face of climate change. Floods have hit New York, Detroit, and Flagstaff, Arizona, in recent weeks. In Germany and Belgium, they have swept away whole towns and left over 1,000 people missing.  A problem: Urban centers are more prone to flooding than other areas because water can’t seep into the ground the way it would in a forest or grassland. Instead, it flows. Stormwater infrastructure around the country is aging, and many governments have resorted to Band-Aid solutions instead of building more resilient systems.  What we need: Coastal cities face even more dire climate threats, and some are investing aggressively to stave them off. Beyond pump stations, cities are installing features like storm ponds and rain gardens to help manage flooding. "

From today, the country is ditching all its remaining pandemic-related restrictions. People will be able to go to nightclubs, or gather in groups as large as they like. They will not be legally compelled to wear masks.  At the same time, coronavirus cases are rapidly rising in the UK. It recorded over 50,000 new cases on Friday, a figure that could breach 100,000 before long.  In theory, a full reopening during a surge in cases sounds like a combustible mix. But the UK government is betting that this time won’t be like the others because of its vaccination program.  Researchers say it’s extremely difficult to predict what will happen next, with multiple overlapping, complex factors at play. Here is what we know, what we don’t know, and what we need to keep an eye on over the coming weeks. "
2021-07-19 12:05:12+00:00,"  Is 57 a prime number? There’s a game for that.  A prime number is a whole number that can only be divided by 1 and itself.  Prime numbers are useful in computing—such as with error-correcting codes and encryption. But while finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number (known as prime factorization) is hard (hence its value in encryption), checking whether a number is prime is easier, if tricky. British mathematician Christian Lawson-Perfect made a game to test yourself doing this.  The aim of the game is to sort as many numbers as possible into “prime” or “not prime” in 60 seconds. Give it a whirl.  —Siobhan Roberts  Why it’s so hard to make tech more diverse  In 2017, Tracy Chou was working to expose Silicon Valley’s diversity issues. As an engineer at Pinterest, she’d published a widely circulated blog post calling for tech companies to share data on how many women worked on their engineering teams. She collected their responses in a public database that revealed how homogeneous many technical teams at top companies still were.  About a year later, Chou started a company called Block Partythat targets online harassment by giving Twitter users more control over which tweets appear in their feed and mentions. The service signed up its first paying customers in January.  With her new company, Chou wants to fix some of the problems she’s experienced firsthand in the tech industry—including the sort of online harassment of which she has been a target.

2021-07-16 12:07:16+00:00,"How to mend your broken pandemic brain    Americans are slowly coming out of the pandemic, but as they reemerge, there’s still a lot of trauma to process. It’s not just our families, our communities, and our jobs that have changed; our brains have changed too. We’re not the same people we were 18 months ago.  During the winter of 2020, more than 40% of Americans reported symptoms of anxiety or depression, double the rate of the previous year. That number dropped to 30% in June 2021 as vaccinations rose and covid-19 cases fell, but that still leaves nearly one in three Americans struggling with their mental health. In addition to diagnosable symptoms, plenty of people reported experiencing pandemic brain fog, including forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, and general fuzziness.  Now the question is, can our brains change back? And how can we help them do that? "
2021-07-16 12:07:16+00:00,"  Why it's so hard to change  Throughout the decades, change has proved difficult—whether you’re trying to make it happen or just reacting to it, as previous issues of MIT Technology Review demonstrate. One story from 1967 claims that resistance to change is mostly borne out of anxiety and self-protection, another from 1971 argues that most broad programs of social change fail, and an article from 1994 articulates anxieties of the time about the coming explosion in internet connectivity.

2021-07-15 12:07:24+00:00,"Welcome to the Tokyo Olympics, where public health, money, and politics collide    What’s happening: The Olympic and Paralympic games are set to begin on July 23 in Tokyo. The backdrop is far from ideal. Covid-19 cases are rising in Tokyo, prompting the city to announce its fourth state of emergency since the start of the pandemic. The rising caseload is especially troubling because the country’s vaccination rate remains low. Just 18% of Japan’s population is fully vaccinated. Nevertheless, the International Olympic Committee is pressing on. At stake are billions of dollars in sunk costs, as well as billions more in potential revenue.  What’s next: Experts worry that the influx of 100,000 people during the games could worsen covid-19 in Japan, despite the safety measures. They will be tested at various intervals, and required to download a contact tracing app. There won’t be any audiences at all at venues in and around Tokyo. Despite this, the Olympics could have a ripple effect on covid cases in the country. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that polls show more than 80% of Japanese people don’t want the games to happen at all. "
2021-07-15 12:07:24+00:00,"  Facebook is ditching plans to make brain-reading headsets  The news: Facebook has announcedit is discontinuing a project launched in 2017 to build a headset or headband that would allow people to send text messages by thinking. It said consumer brain-reading remains very far off, and it will instead focus on an experimental wrist controller for virtual reality that reads muscle signals in the arm.  The bigger picture: There’s still a craze around brain-computer interfaces more generally. That’s because companies see mind-controlled software as a huge breakthrough—as important as the computer mouse, graphical user interface, or swipe screen.  Woah there: As brain-computer interfaces advance, there are serious new concerns. What would happen if large tech companies could know people’s thoughts? Given Facebook’s poor record on privacy, the decision to halt this research may have the side benefit of putting some distance between the company and rising worries about “neurorights.” "
2021-07-14 12:07:59+00:00,"The lurking threat to solar power’s growth    The problem: Solar power faces a fundamental challengethat could halt the industry’s breakneck growth. Simply put: the more solar you add to the grid, the less valuable it becomes. The problem is that solar panels generate lots of electricity in the middle of sunny days, frequently more than what’s required, driving down prices—sometimes even into negative territory. And solar plant operators can’t easily throttle electricity up and down as needed.  How it’s manifesting: A new report has concluded that California is already experiencing this phenomenon, known as solar value deflation. The state’s average solar wholesale prices have fallen 37% relative to the average electricity prices for other sources since 2014, according to the Breakthrough Institute analysis. It could soon become a broader problem around the world.  Why it matters: Lower prices may sound great for consumers. But it presents troubling implications for the world’s hopes of rapidly expanding solar capacity and meeting climate goals. "
2021-07-14 12:07:59+00:00,"  The world’s biggest ransomware gang just disappeared from the internet  The news: One of the most prolific ransomware gangs in the world suddenly disappeared from the interneton Tuesday morning. The ransomware crew known as REvil is responsible for a whopping 42% of all recent ransomware attacks, but they're known for two hacks in particular: the one on Kaseya earlier this month, and the attack on meat supplier JBS.  Why now? There are a few possible explanations. First, the gang itself may have chosen to retire if they’ve made enough money or felt too much pressure. The United States or its allies may have taken them offline. Or the Russian government, under international scrutiny, may have forced them to shut down. Their disappearance could also be temporary.  Interesting timing: The unexplained exodus came just one day before senior officials from the White House and Russia are scheduled to meet to discuss the global ransomware crisis. "
2021-07-13 12:07:42+00:00,"Here’s what we know about kids and long covid    The risk to children: When it comes to covid, kids have largely been spared. They can get infected and spread the virus, but they have little risk of becoming seriously ill or dying. Yet, just like adults, they can have symptoms that persist well beyond the initial infection. This condition is often referred to as “long” covid. Symptoms in kids mirror those seen in adults: fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, respiratory problems, chest tightness or pain, and heart palpitations.  What we know: Even in countries with high vaccination rates, the virus is still circulating among children, the vast majority of whom are either yet to be vaccinated, or ineligible for vaccination. There are only a handful of studies to draw on for kids and long covid, but data from the UK suggests that 10-13% of kids who test positive for covid have symptoms for more than five weeks. Rates from studies in other countries are lower.  What we don’t know: Lots! We don’t know what causes long covid. And we don’t know which kids are more susceptible to it either, although there’s some indication that older kids are at greater risk. There are some anecdotal reports suggesting that vaccination can help to curb long covid, but there’s no data specific to children yet. "
2021-07-13 12:07:42+00:00,"  Welcome to TikTok’s endless cycle of censorship and mistakes  A worrying example: Last week, TikTok creator Ziggi Tyler noticed something disturbingabout how creator bios were being automatically moderated on the app. When he tried to enter certain phrases in his bio, some of them, such as “Black lives matter” and “supporting Black success”, were flagged as inappropriate content. But “I am a neo nazi” and “I am an anti semetic” were acceptable.  The bigger picture: Although TikTok apologized for the “significant” error, caused by an automatic filter set to block words associated with hate speech, it’s far from the only such incident to take place on the platform. A pattern repeats on TikTok: a creator flags a bizarre and potentially harmful issue with its moderation or algorithm, a journalist asks the company to explain, and the issue is fixed. TikTok then releases a statement saying that the problem was the result of an error.  What’s needed: Part of the answer is one of the most longstanding stories in tech: TikTok needs tohire, and listen to, people from a diversity of backgrounds. But greater transparency also has to be part of the solution. "
2021-07-12 12:07:58+00:00,"What Richard Branson's flight to the edge of space means for space tourism    Yesterday, July 11, British entrepreneur and billionaire Richard Branson shot to the edge of space in a vehicle made by his own company, Virgin Galactic.  In the early hours of yesterday morning, Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity spaceplane took off from Spaceport America in the Mojave Desert, California. Its crew of six, including Branson, was lifted to an altitude of more than 14 kilometers before it was dropped, allowing its single rocket engine to ignite and carry its occupants towards space.  Slightly more than a minute later, traveling at speeds of Mach 3, it reached its maximum altitude – 86 kilometers – affording its crew several minutes of weightlessness and gorgeous views of Earth before safely descending back to Earth, with a total flight time of around 90 minutes.  Yet while the childish race between Branson and Jeff Bezos to be the first billionaire into space has attracted plenty of criticism, yesterday’s flight heralds a key step towards making space travel more accessible than ever before—even if it does just seem like a plaything for the world’s richest men right now.
